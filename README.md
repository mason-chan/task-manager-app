## Details

This was the final group project for the web developer program at Generation USA. By combining all the things we learned throughout the course, we were tasked to create a task manager app using pure HTML/JavaScript and utilzing Bootstrap and its classes to style the page. My group and I went through the multiple steps when it comes to designing and developing a webpage/app, from wireframing to implementation. The goal was to create a simple CRUD app that also stored the data locally so the information would still be present for the specific user visiting the page.

This project exposed us to learning how to work in teams, from dividing up the work to letting everyone share their opinions and work together to come up with a common goal. It definitely introduced us to what it would be like to work on the job, and we were able to practice both our technical skills as well as soft skills. Working on this project was also a refresher for me as it required me to visit the core fundamentals of web development where I had to use technologies that I was new to (Bootstrap) and ones that I haven't used in a while (pure HTML/JavaScript). 

## Project Status

This project at its core is complete. Visitors can create new tasks, mark them as complete, track their total progression, and remove any tasks they wish, while keeping their data saved to their local storage. The app can also be improved upon to incorporate more functionality, such as editing existing tasks or possibly adding sections for cases such as business tasks and personal tasks.
