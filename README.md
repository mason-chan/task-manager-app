## Purpose
This was the final group project for the web developer program at Generation USA. By combining all the things we learned throughout the course, we were tasked to create a task manager app that had basic CRUD functionality. My group and I went through the multiple steps when it comes to designing and developing a webpage/app, from wireframing to implementation.

## Details

The technologies used to make this web application are HTML5, JavaScript ES6, and Bootstrap v5.2.2.The focus of this project was to use the web development fundamentals taught throughout the class and put all of them into action. We started out this project by creating a wireframe through Moqup, working together on a design that we all liked. We then worked on implementing that wireframe by writing up the HTML and utilizing Bootstrap to style the page similar to our wireframe design. For the last steps, we implemented the functionality through JavaScript which included DOM manipulation and utilizing local storage to save the user's data.

This project exposed us to working in teams, from dividing up the work to letting everyone share their opinions and work together to come up with a common goal. It definitely introduced us to what it would be like to work on the job, and we were able to practice both our technical skills as well as soft skills. Working on this project was also a refresher for me as it required me to visit the core fundamentals of web development where I had to use technologies that I was new to (Bootstrap) and ones that I haven't used in a while (pure HTML/JavaScript). It was definitely a great experience for my time at the bootcamp.

## Project Status

This project at its core is complete. Visitors can create new tasks, mark them as complete, track their total progression, and remove any tasks they wish, while keeping their data saved to their local storage. The app can also be further improved upon to incorporate more functionality, such as modifying existing tasks or possibly adding different sections for things such as business tasks and personal tasks.
